# The Ruins Mod

*You weren't the first to come here... you won't be the last...*

Ruins adds a good amount of randomly spawning ruins to world generation. These ruins are destroyed fragments of bases, small forts, etc. There are three categories of ruins, small, medium, and large, with respective decreasing spawn chance per generated chunk.

Explore them for loot, adventure, or entertainment, but beware, some still have running defenses from the last player that landed on the planet, with more successful colonies having better defenses. The biters have deactivated these defenses towards themselves, but the turrets won't recognize you...

The ruin defenses can be set to be non-hostile in the mod settings. The spawn rates of ruins are also configurable.

The remote interfaces that this mod provides are described with comments at the end of [control.lua](control.lua#L81).
